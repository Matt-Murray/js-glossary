## Reflection
This project was completed as part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification curriculum. The purpose of the project was to create a technical documentation page that would serve as practice in creating responsive webpages with HTML5 and CSS and to reinforce my knowledge of/serve as a reference for basic JavaScript terminology.
